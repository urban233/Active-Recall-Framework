# Active-Recall Framework
 
This is a repo to manage Anki Decks related to science.

A Guide on how to import, export and commiting is here:

### Important note:
* You need to install GitHub Desktop!
* You have to overwrite the deck.josn and the media directory!

### I made a lot of changes in the Active-Recall-Framework deck: 
1. I used flags to indicate problematic cards
2. I used tags to categorize these problematic cards
3. I created some kind of own operator to note on some cards (operator is "::")
4. I suspended some cards which have to be changed before they get back into the main deck
